# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quantity of production for various types of crops using Machine Learning. 
The project consists of four main components:

- Data Ingestion, 
- Data Transformation, 
- Model Training, 
- Prediction Pipeline.
  

## Project Structure

 **src/:**  Contains the main application code and prediction pipeline.<br>
 
 **components/:** Contains modules for data ingestion, data transformation, and model training.
 pipeline.<br>
 
 **pipeline/:** Contains two main pipelines - prediction_pipeline and train_pipeline.<br>
 
 **logs/:** Folder to store logs generated during the project.<br>
 
 **utils/:** Contains utility functions for logging, exception handling,  saving/loading objects and extracting data from mongodb.<br>
 
 **exception/:** To handle exceptions and raise custom exceptions with detailed error messages.


## Installation
To install the required packages, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
- numpy==1.26.4
- pandas==2.2.2
- flask==3.0.3
- scikit-learn==1.4.2
- seaborn==0.13.2
- pymongo==4.6.3
- datetime==5.5


## Pipeline Overview
The project pipeline consists of the following stages:

**Data Ingestion:** Connect to MongoDB and retrieve the dataset.<br>

**Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical features.<br>

**Model Training:** Train various regression models to predict crop yields.<br>

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained models using R-squared score.<br>

**Prediction:** Deploy the best-performing model for crop yield prediction via a web interface.<br>


## Data Ingestion
**Data Source:** The dataset is retrieved from a MongoDB database. It includes features such as nutrient levels (N, P, K), pH, rainfall, temperature, area in hectares, state name, crop type, and crop.<br>

**Process**
- Connect to MongoDB and retrieve data.
- Save the data as a CSV file.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Data Transformation
**Preprocessing:** The data undergoes the following preprocessing steps:<br>

**Imputation:**  Missing values are imputed using median for numerical features and most frequent value for categorical features.<br>

**Scaling:** Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler.<br>

**Encoding:** Categorical features are encoded using OrdinalEncoder.<br>



**Pipeline:** The preprocessing steps are combined into a pipeline using ColumnTransformer.

## Model Training
**Models Used**
Several regression models are trained and evaluated:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression



## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using R-squared score on the test set. The best-performing model is saved for future predictions.



## Prediction Pipeline

The **prediction_pipeline** folder contains the following components:<br>

**PredictPipeline Class:** This class loads the preprocessed data and the trained model to make predictions.<br>

**CustomData Class:** This class takes input features and converts them into a DataFrame suitable for prediction.<br>


## Deployment
The project has been deployed on an AWS EC2 instance and is accessible via the following link:
